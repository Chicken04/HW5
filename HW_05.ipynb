    "# Computer Homework 5: Numerical solutions to $RC$ circuits\n",
    "This week, you've learned about resistors, capacitors, and the current that passes through these circuits.  This coming week, you will see how combining these elements can lead to interesting time dependence, specifically when we put resistors and capacitors in series with one another.  Most simple circuits can be solved using a variety of techniques.  As circuits become more complicated, or as the signals the circuits are processing become more complicated, finding an exact solution can become more difficult.  \n",

    "This simple definition implies that many circuits can be expressed in the language of differential equations. The purpose of this assignment is to learn how to solve these equations numerically. \n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution to this equation is a function $x(t)$ whose first derivative is $f$.\n",
    "To find the solution to such an equation, we also need boundary conditions, or starting points.  Suppose that we have a first-order differential equation and know the value of $x$ for some specific time $t$, that is we know $x(t)$.  The we can write the value of x some short time later as\n",

    "Using this, if we know the value of $x$ at some time $t$ we can find the value at some short time later.  We can then repeat this process and understand how $x$ changes over time. The set of $x$ values at a discrete set of $t$ values is the numerical solution to our differential equation.\n",
    "\n",
